        /*In Spring and reactive programming, flatMap is an operator used to transform the elements emitted by a reactive stream (such as a Mono or a Flux) while potentially triggering new asynchronous operations.
        It allows you to work with nested or multiple asynchronous operations in a structured and efficient way.
        Here's a brief explanation of how flatMap works.
        Transforming Elements: The flatMap operator takes each element emitted by the source reactive stream and applies a transformation function to it. This function returns another reactive stream (Mono or Flux) that represents the result of the transformation.
        Flattening Nested Streams: The key feature of flatMap is that it automatically flattens the nested reactive streams into a single reactive stream. This means that if your transformation function returns a Mono or a Flux, flatMap will ensure that the nested reactive stream's emissions are seamlessly integrated into the main stream.
        Concurrent Execution: flatMap also has the advantage of potentially executing the transformation functions concurrently, which can improve efficiency and overall performance.*/

        /* In Spring's reactive programming framework, specifically in the context of Project Reactor,
           the doOnError() operator is used to perform an action when an error occurs within a reactive stream.
           This operator allows you to define a callback that will be executed whenever an error is encountered while processing the elements of the stream. */

        /* In Spring's reactive programming framework, specifically in the context of Project Reactor,
           the onErrorResume() operator is used to handle errors that might occur during the processing of a reactive stream.
           This operator allows you to provide an alternative source of elements in case an error occurs,
           effectively "resuming" the stream with a fallback behavior */
